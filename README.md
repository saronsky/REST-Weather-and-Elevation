Uses C# to allow users to input a city and receive the current weather and city elevation


Running this executable should be very simple:
1. First go to the directory to which the .zip folder was downloaded, extract the folder, and enter the expanded version. 
2. Then type in the code "Program2Simon" followed by the name of the city you want to test. 
3. If the name of the city has a space in it, please be sure to wrap it in quotes (e.g. Program2Simon "New York City")
